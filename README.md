# dominator-material

This crate aims to provide  basic reactive material components to be used for writing UI applications using dominator.

It provides an example SCSS implementation to use as a template, but I recommend developing styling per application.


## Examples

To run the showcase application, go to the `examples/component_showcase` directory, and do the following:

Requires rust 1.47.0+ , npm and nodejs.

```
npm i && npm start
``` 

Go to http://localhost:8080 to see the showcase.
